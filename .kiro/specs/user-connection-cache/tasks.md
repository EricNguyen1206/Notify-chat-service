  - Write integration tests for Hub and cache interaction
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 5. Enhance channel subscription management

  - Update `WsAddChannel()` method to register user in connection cache channel mapping
  - Update `WsRemoveChannel()` method to remove user from connection cache channel mapping
  - Ensure cache consistency when clients join/leave channels
  - Write tests for channel subscription cache updates
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 6. Implement optimized message broadcasting

  - Modify `BroadcastMessage()` method to use connection cache for targeted delivery
  - Update broadcasting logic in `WsRun()` to use cache for efficient user lookup

  - _Requirements: 4.4, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 9. Add comprehensive error handling and monitoring

  - Implement `ErrorHandler` interface for connection and broadcast error management
  - Add logging for cache operations and performance metrics
  - Implement graceful degradation when cache operations fail
  - Add monitoring hooks for connection count and broadcast performance
  - Write tests for error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 10. Create integration tests and performance validation
  - Write end-to-end tests for complete message flow from API to WebSocket clients
