# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a user connection cache system that maintains real-time tracking of online users and enables message broadcasting to all connected users within specific channels. The system will enhance the existing chat service by providing efficient user presence management and real-time message distribution capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chat service, I want to maintain a cache of all online user connections, so that I can efficiently track user presence and enable real-time communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user establishes a WebSocket connection THEN the system SHALL add the user to the connection cache
2. WHEN a user disconnects THEN the system SHALL remove the user from the connection cache
3. WHEN querying online users THEN the system SHALL return all currently connected users
4. IF a connection becomes stale or inactive THEN the system SHALL automatically remove it from the cache

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chat application, I want to broadcast messages to all online users in a specific channel, so that real-time communication can occur between channel members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat API call is made with a channel message THEN the system SHALL identify all online users in that channel
2. WHEN broadcasting a message THEN the system SHALL send the message to all connected users in the target channel
3. IF a user is not online THEN the system SHALL skip that user during broadcast
4. WHEN a broadcast fails for a specific connection THEN the system SHALL remove the failed connection from the cache

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the connection cache to be thread-safe and performant, so that it can handle concurrent operations without data corruption or performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple goroutines access the connection cache simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions
2. WHEN adding or removing connections THEN the system SHALL use appropriate locking mechanisms
3. WHEN broadcasting to multiple users THEN the system SHALL handle operations concurrently for optimal performance
4. IF the cache grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable performance characteristics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the connection cache to integrate seamlessly with the existing WebSocket hub, so that minimal changes are required to the current architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with the existing hub.go THEN the system SHALL extend current functionality without breaking existing features
2. WHEN a user joins or leaves a channel THEN the system SHALL update the connection cache accordingly
3. WHEN the chat API processes a message THEN the system SHALL use the connection cache for broadcasting
4. IF the existing WebSocket infrastructure changes THEN the connection cache SHALL adapt without requiring major refactoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chat user, I want to receive messages in real-time when I'm online, so that I can participate in active conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I am connected to a channel THEN I SHALL receive all messages sent to that channel in real-time
2. WHEN I join a new channel THEN I SHALL be added to that channel's broadcast list
3. WHEN I leave a channel THEN I SHALL no longer receive messages from that channel
4. IF my connection is interrupted THEN I SHALL be automatically removed from all broadcast lists
