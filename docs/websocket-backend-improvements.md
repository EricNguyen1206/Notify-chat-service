# WebSocket Backend Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve WebSocket race conditions and goroutine lifecycle problems.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Channel Closure Race Conditions
- **Problem**: Double-close panics when both `unregisterClient()` and `SendMessage()` tried to close the send channel
- **Solution**: Added atomic flags and safe channel closure methods

### 2. Goroutine Lifecycle Management
- **Problem**: Orphaned goroutines during rapid reconnections causing resource leaks
- **Solution**: Added proper coordination with context cancellation and wait groups

### 3. Redis State Consistency
- **Problem**: User online/offline state conflicts during rapid disconnect/reconnect cycles
- **Solution**: Added proper sequencing and delay mechanisms for Redis operations

### 4. Connection State Management
- **Problem**: No validation or cleanup of stale connections
- **Solution**: Added connection state tracking and periodic cleanup

## Key Changes Made

### Client Structure Enhancements (`internal/websocket/client.go`)

```go
type Client struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // Connection state management
    ctx        context.Context
    cancel     context.CancelFunc
    closed     int32 // atomic flag to track if client is closed
    sendClosed int32 // atomic flag to track if send channel is closed
    
    // Goroutine coordination
    wg sync.WaitGroup // Wait group for goroutine coordination
}
```

### Safe Channel Operations

```go
// isClosed returns true if the client is closed
func (c *Client) isClosed() bool {
    return atomic.LoadInt32(&c.closed) == 1
}

// closeSendChannel safely closes the send channel
func (c *Client) closeSendChannel() {
    if atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32(&c.sendClosed, 0, 1) {
        close(c.send)
        slog.Debug("Send channel closed", "clientID", c.id, "userID", c.userID)
    }
}
```

### Improved Goroutine Management

- Implemented context cancellation
- Added timeout for unregister requests
- Enhanced error logging with client context

#### WritePump Enhancements
- Added wait group tracking
- Implemented context-aware message sending
- Improved error handling and logging
- Fixed message queuing logic

### Hub Improvements (`internal/websocket/hub.go`)

#### Enhanced Client Registration
```go
func (h *Hub) registerClient(client *Client) {
    // Check if client is already closed (race condition protection)
    if client.isClosed() {
        slog.Warn("Attempted to register closed client", "clientID", client.id, "userID", client.userID)
        return
    }
    
    // Track existing clients for Redis state management
    existingClients := len(h.userClients[client.userID])
    wasUserOnline := existingClients > 0
    
    // Only set user online in Redis if this is the first client
    if !wasUserOnline {
        // Set user online...
    }
}
```

#### Smart Client Unregistration
```go
func (h *Hub) unregisterClient(client *Client) {
    // Careful Redis state management with delay for rapid reconnections
    if shouldSetOffline {
        go func() {
            time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond) // Handle rapid reconnections
            
            // Double-check that user is still offline after delay
            h.mu.RLock()
            stillOffline := len(h.userClients[client.userID]) == 0
            h.mu.RUnlock()
            
            if stillOffline {
                h.redisService.SetUserOffline(h.ctx, client.userID)
            }
        }()
    }
}
```

#### Connection State Tracking
```go
type Hub struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    
    // Connection state management
    clientRegistrationTime map[*Client]time.Time // Track when clients were registered
    cleanupTicker          *time.Ticker          // Periodic cleanup of stale connections
}
```

#### Periodic Cleanup
```go
func (h *Hub) cleanupStaleConnections() {
    // Remove clients that have been inactive for too long
    // Clean up stale connections and log statistics
}
```

### WebSocket Handler Improvements (`internal/api/handlers/websocket.go`)

#### Enhanced Validation
```go
func (h *WSHandler) validateUserID(userID string) (string, error) {
    if userID == "" {
        return "", &ValidationError{Field: "userId", Message: "userId parameter is required"}
    }
    
    // Validate numeric user ID
    if _, err := strconv.ParseUint(userID, 10, 64); err != nil {
        return "", &ValidationError{Field: "userId", Message: "userId must be a valid number"}
    }
    
    return userID, nil
}
```

#### Comprehensive Logging
```go
func (h *WSHandler) HandleWebSocket(c *gin.Context) {
    startTime := time.Now()
    clientIP := c.ClientIP()
    userAgent := c.GetHeader("User-Agent")
    
    // Enhanced logging and error handling
    slog.Info("WebSocket connection request", 
        "userID", validatedUserID, 
        "clientIP", clientIP, 
        "userAgent", userAgent)
}
```

## Benefits of the Improvements

### 1. Eliminated Race Conditions

- Thread-safe channel operations
- Proper goroutine coordination

### 2. Resource Leak Prevention
- Proper goroutine lifecycle management

- Automatic cleanup of stale connections

### 3. Improved Reliability

- Connection statistics tracking
- Performance metrics collection

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Connection Resilience
- Test rapid page reloads (< 100ms intervals)
- Test network disconnection/reconnection
- Test server restarts during active connections
- Test concurrent connections from same user

### 2. Load Testing
- Test with multiple simultaneous connections
- Test message throughput under load
- Test cleanup performance with many stale connections

### 3. Edge Cases
- Test invalid user IDs
- Test malformed WebSocket requests
- Test Redis connection failures
- Test database connection issues

## Monitoring and Observability

The improved implementation includes extensive logging at different levels:

- **Debug**: Detailed connection lifecycle events
- **Info**: Connection establishment and user actions
- **Warn**: Recoverable issues and timeouts
- **Error**: Critical failures requiring attention

Key metrics to monitor:
- Active connection count
- Connection establishment rate
- Reconnection frequency
- Message queue sizes
- Cleanup operation frequency

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy to staging first and monitor connection behavior
2. **Redis Monitoring**: Watch for increased Redis operations during deployment
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor for any memory leaks during extended operation
4. **Connection Limits**: Verify system can handle expected concurrent connections
5. **Log Volume**: Adjust log levels based on production requirements

These improvements provide a robust, production-ready WebSocket implementation that handles edge cases gracefully and provides reliable real-time messaging capabilities.
